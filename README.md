Use github actions and Lakka repository to compile libretro cores for armv7-neon-hf devices.

One possible use is update Lakka or Batocera cores.

With each core there is an 'extra' folder that includes xml/dat files and some other files (inside the zip file).

Download the available cores in folder cores_armv7-neon-hf
